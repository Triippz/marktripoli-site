# Executive Briefing ‚Äî Easter Eggs

A few playful, screen‚Äëonly effects are hidden in the Executive Briefing page (`/briefing`). They don‚Äôt affect printing and don‚Äôt require network calls or extra deps.

How to trigger
- Konami Code: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A
  - Toggles Matrix‚Äëstyle ‚Äúdigital rain‚Äù overlay.
- U ‚Äî UFO Fleet
  - Spawns 3‚Äì5 glowing UFOs that fly across the screen at random heights/speeds.
- D ‚Äî Paw Print Burst
  - Rains üêæ paw prints. Because dogs.
- G ‚Äî Glitch Header
  - Brief cyberpunk glitch effect on your name.
- P ‚Äî Neon Pulse
  - Subtle neon border pulse on panels.
- H ‚Äî Hiking Mode
  - Drops mountain icons üèîÔ∏è with gentle parallax.
- V ‚Äî Video Game Mode
  - Toggles CRT scanlines overlay with a soft flicker.
- B ‚Äî UFO Beam
  - A hovering saucer appears with a tractor‚Äëbeam spotlight over the header.
- ` (backtick) or Ctrl+Alt+T ‚Äî Secret Terminal
  - Open a hidden terminal overlay. Type 'help' to see commands.
  - 'login' then password 'legion' for admin. 3 wrong attempts => alert mode.
  - 'eggs', 'trigger <name>', 'scan', 'unlock-all' to play with effects.
  - Map Terminal (same hotkeys on map): 'regions', 'goto <key>', 'zoom <n>', 'center <lng> <lat>', 'scan'.
  - Achievements persist (unlockedEasterEggs/localStorage) and show in the üèÜ panel.

Implementation notes
- All effects live in `src/pages/ExecutiveBrief.tsx` and `src/styles/tactical-enhancements.css`.
- Effects are gated to screen rendering and avoid pointer events.
- GitHub Side Projects fetch stars/forks (no API key) with a 24h localStorage cache.
