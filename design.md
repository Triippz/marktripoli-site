# Mission Control Personal Site — Design Doc

## 1) Summary

Create a personal website that feels like operating a command‑and‑control (C2) console for autonomous systems. The **map is the hub**; each job, project, and hobby is a “mission site.” Clicking a site opens a **terminal/dossier** with immersive animations, tasking orders, telemetry logs, and mini‑interactions. Brand style: **black / white / neon green**.

---

## 2) Goals & Non‑Goals

**Goals**

* Convey career story, skills, and personality through an interactive C2 metaphor.
* Encourage deep engagement via mini‑missions (hobbies, easter eggs) and terminal interactions.
* Keep performance high and UX accessible on desktop and mobile.
* Make content maintainable via structured data (JSON/MD files or headless CMS).

**Non‑Goals**

* Not a blog engine (phase 1). No account creation. No real device control.

---

## 3) Audience & Personas

* **Hiring Managers / Recruiters**: Quickly grasp impact, skills, and contact you.
* **Engineers / Tech Peers**: Explore deeper technical dossiers, projects, and code.
* **Friends / Curious Visitors**: Discover hobbies and easter eggs, have fun.

---

## 4) Narrative & Concept

The visitor establishes a **secure link to Mission Control**. The globe/map shows **mission sites** (companies, HQs, projects, places). Selecting one triggers **tasking orders** and a **terminal** that “downloads” the dossier with animated logs. Hobbies appear as **auxiliary missions** (e.g., K9, hiking, MTB, electronics, aliens). The experience builds a **cumulative ops log** of everything the visitor has unlocked.

---

## 5) Information Architecture (IA)

* **Landing / Boot Sequence** → Map (Mission Control)
* **Map**

    * Sites: Jobs (Picogrid, HubSpot, etc.), Projects, Hobbies
    * Global HUD: telemetry ticker, status lights, role selector (Analyst/Operator/Commander)
* **Dossier / Terminal** (per site)

    * Mission Briefing (summary)
    * Deployment Logs (bullets/achievements)
    * After‑Action Report (lessons/skills)
    * Media (images, trails, links)
    * Actions (send tasking orders, open mini‑mission)
* **Side Missions** (hobbies & mini‑games)
* **Contact / Debrief** (encrypted transmission form)

## 7) Screen Blueprints

**Landing / Boot**

* Fullscreen CRT boot: “INIT SYSTEMS… VERIFYING KEYS… SECURE LINK ESTABLISHED.”
* Progress bar pulses → auto transitions to Map.

**Mission Control / Map**

* Mapbox globe or 2D dark map, neon green accents.
* Site pins with pulsing rings; tactical grid lines; occasional radar sweep.
* Sidebar mini‑console: telemetry ticker, log feed, role selector.
* Footer: ops log accumulating visitor actions.

**Dossier / Terminal**

* Green‑on‑black terminal overlay.
* Tabbed or typed navigation between: Briefing, Logs, AAR, Media, Actions.
* “Downloading mission package…” typewriter animation; then content renders.

**Side Missions**

* Small contained modules (mini‑game canvas, trail map, electronics terminal).

**Debrief / Contact**

* Encrypted message form; animation on send: “TRANSMISSION SENT. LINK CLOSING.”

---

## 8) Interactions & Microcopy

**Telemetry Ticker (examples)**

```
[16:45:12] UAS-01 en route to PICOGRID HQ
[16:45:13] Data uplink established
[16:45:14] Dossier download queued: OPERATION HUBSPOT
```

**Terminal Commands (fake but clickable)**

* `open dossier <site>` → loads Briefing.
* `show logs` → Deployment Logs.
* `aar` → After‑Action Report.
* `task <objective>` → plays tasking order animation.
* `role set commander` → changes HUD.
* Easter eggs: `sudo aliens`, `k9 deploy`, `drone follow me`.

**Tasking Orders (job/project sites)**

* Form selects objective (e.g., “Cloud Infra Hardening”).
* Sends an animated “OPORD” card with stamped seals; triggers logs and progress.

**Progress/Unlocks**

* First visit: limited intel. After 2+ dossiers, additional sections or easter eggs unlock.

---

## 9) Gamification & Easter Eggs

* **Rank System**: Visitor rank increases via interactions; badge in HUD.
* **UFO Flyover**: Random sprite crosses map; clicking reveals redacted intel.
* **Trail Recon**: For Hiking/MTB, unlock altitude profile after viewing photos.
* **Electronics**: Typing `flash firmware` prints a success log and reveals a project link.

---

## 10) Visual Design

**Palette**: `#000` black, `#111` UI panels, **neon green** (brand), white for body copy, subtle gray for secondary text.

**Type**: Monospace for terminals (e.g., JetBrains Mono), geometric sans for headings (e.g., Inter).

**Layout**: Grid‑based, 12‑column on desktop; stacked cards on mobile.

**Motion**: Quick, snappy; use easing and low‑alpha glow. Avoid heavy blur on mobile.

**Iconography**: Simple line icons (radar, UAV, K9). Minimalist.

**Sound**: Optional toggled SFX (radio clicks, key clacks, radar ping).

---

## 11) Content Model (Structured Data)

**Job Site**

```json
{
  "id": "picogrid",
  "type": "job",
  "name": "Picogrid",
  "hq": { "lat": 34.0901, "lng": -118.4065 },
  "period": { "start": "2023-05", "end": "2025-09" },
  "briefing": "Led redesign of data integration layer and C2 modules.",
  "deploymentLogs": [
    "Architected multi-tenant integration layer",
    "Built event-driven pipelines",
    "Drove IL-5/IL-6 aligned controls"
  ],
  "afterAction": [
    "Lessons on modular monolith vs microservices",
    "NATS JetStream patterns for durability"
  ],
  "media": ["/img/picogrid-1.jpg"],
  "links": [{"label": "Project Notes", "url": "/projects/picogrid"}]
}
```

**Hobby Site**

```json

  "id": "k9",
  "type": "hobby",
  "name": "K9 Unit",
  "markerIcon": "dog",
  "hq": { "lat": 34.05, "lng": -118.25 },
  "module": "k9Logs",
  "logs": ["Companion asset deployed.", "Objective: fetch ball."]
}
```

---

## 12) Architecture (High‑Level)

* **Frontend**: React (Next.js) + Mapbox GL JS for map; component‑driven UI.
* **State**: Lightweight global store (Zustand) + URL state for sharable deep links.
* **Content**: Local JSON/MD for v1; optional Headless CMS later (Contentlayer/Sanity).
* **Audio**: WebAudio toggled via HUD; persisted in localStorage.
* **Analytics**: Simple event tracking (page views, pin clicks, terminal commands).
* **SEO**: Static metadata, OpenGraph images; light SSR/ISR where helpful.

**Key Components**

* `MapScene` (Mapbox wrapper), `MissionPin`, `FlightPath`, `RadarSweep`
* `HUD` (status lights, role selector, telemetry ticker)
* `Terminal` (typewriter, command router, tabbed panels)
* `Dossier` (briefing/logs/AAR/media)
* `TaskingOrders` (form + animation)
* `SideMissions/*` (Gaming, K9, Trails, Electronics, Aliens)
* `DebriefForm` (encrypted contact)

**Component Relationships (Mermaid)**

## 13) Map & Motion Design

* **Pins**: Pulsing neon with soft outer ring; hover reveals codename; click zooms and draws path.
* **Paths**: Animated line along great‑circle arcs between sites (work history sequence).
* **Camera**: Smooth easing to site; slight tilt; adaptive to viewport.
* **Overlays**: Grid, radar sweep, occasional blips/UFO sprite.
* **Dark Mode Only (v1)**; ensure sufficient contrast.

---

## 14) Responsive Strategy

**Breakpoints**

* **Desktop (≥1280px)**: Map + HUD + side panel visible simultaneously.
* **Tablet (768–1279px)**: Map with collapsible HUD/panel.
* **Mobile (≤767px)**: Fullscreen map; pins → sheet/modal terminal; reduced effects.

**Adaptations**

* Lower particle density, motion, and audio defaults on mobile.
* Touch targets ≥ 44px; swipe to close terminal.

---

## 15) Accessibility (a11y)

* Keyboard: Tab navigation on pins and terminal; arrow keys pan map (or toggled).
* ARIA: Live region for telemetry; meaningful labels for pins (“Open Picogrid dossier”).
* Motion: “Reduce Motion” respects OS setting; provide toggle.
* Color contrast: neon on black checked against WCAG AA.

---

## 16) Performance & Budget

* **LCP** < 2.5s on 4G (home page); JS budget ≤ \~200KB gzipped initial.
* Code‑split side missions and terminal heavy effects.
* GPU‑friendly animations; avoid layout thrash; prefer CSS transforms.
* Pre‑render map shell; defer heavy layers until idle.

**Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI budget, Sentry for errors, simple perf logging.

---

## 17) Security & Privacy

* No real control; clearly fictional. Use copy like “SIMULATION MODE.”
* Contact form: spam protection (honeypot), rate‑limited endpoint.
* Minimal cookies; store preferences in localStorage; consent banner if analytics.

---

## 18) Analytics & Telemetry (Site)

* Events: `pin_click`, `terminal_open`, `command_executed`, `tasking_sent`, `easter_egg_found`, `contact_sent`.
* Funnel: Landing → Map → Dossier → Contact.
* Respect Do Not Track; allow opt‑out.

---

## 19) Copy Seeds (Feel / Voice)

**Boot**: “INIT SYSTEMS… HANDSHAKE OK… AUTH MARK TRIPOLI… LINK SECURE.”

**Tasking Order**: “OPORD 17‑A: OBJECTIVE — DEMONSTRATE C2 + DATA LAYER EXPERTISE. EXECUTION — OPEN DOSSIER, REVIEW LOGS, TRANSMIT ORDERS.”

**K9**: “COMPANION ASSET ONLINE. MORALE BOOST: +10.”

**Aliens**: “UNIDENTIFIED CONTACT. CLASSIFICATION: FRIENDLY(?) INTERCEPTED SIGNAL ATTACHED.”

---

## 20) Roadmap & Milestones

**M1: Core Shell (2–3 days)**

* Landing boot → Map scene; pins from JSON; click → placeholder terminal.
* HUD with telemetry ticker; basic theme tokens.

**M2: Terminal + Dossier (3–5 days)**

* Typewriter download; tabs/commands; render job content.

**M3: Side Missions (3–5 days)**

* K9 logs, simple gaming mini‑game, trail visualizer, electronics terminal.

**M4: Tasking Orders + Debrief (2–3 days)**

* OPORD animation; contact form with send effect.

**M5: Polish (2–4 days)**

* Motion tuning, a11y, perf budget, analytics, sound toggle, easter eggs.

---

## 21) Risks & Mitigations

* **Performance on mobile**: aggressively code‑split, feature‑flag heavy effects.
* **Mapbox token/regressions**: nightly smoke tests; fallback to static map tiles.
* **Scope creep**: ship v1 with 2–3 jobs + 3 hobbies.

---

## 22) Future Extensions

* Blog entries as new intel packets.
* Three.js starfield or globe with satellite orbits.
* Real‑time “comms” chat bot persona.
* CMS authoring UI for dossiers and missions.

---

## 23) Implementation Preview (High‑Level)

* **Framework**: Next.js (App Router), React 18.
* **Map**: Mapbox GL JS (dark style), custom layers for flight paths & sweeps.
* **State**: Zustand store for UI; URL params for deep links (`?site=picogrid&tab=aar`).
* **Styling**: Tailwind (tokens: `--mc-green`, `--mc-panel`, etc.).
* **Animations**: Framer Motion + CSS transforms; requestAnimationFrame for sweeps.
* **Audio**: Small clips preloaded; toggle in HUD; respect prefers‑reduced‑motion for SFX too.
* **Content**: `/data/sites/*.json` + image assets in `/public/img`.

**Acceptance (v1)**

* From landing → map → open at least one dossier and one side mission.
* Tasking order plays & logs event. Contact sends message and shows confirmation.
* Works on desktop/mobile; keyboard and screen reader basic pass.

---

## 24) Fast Path / Executive Briefing (Skip‑the‑Fun Shortcut)

**Goal:** Provide a one‑click, keyboard, or URL shortcut to a concise, high‑signal overview for busy visitors.

**Entry Points**

* **Header CTA:** "EXECUTIVE BRIEFING" (always visible).
* **Boot Screen Skip Link (a11y):** `Skip to Executive Briefing` announced to screen readers and focusable.
* **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press `B` (or `Cmd/Ctrl + B`) anywhere → open briefing.
* **Command Palette:** `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → type `brief` → open.
* **URL:** `/briefing` or `/?mode=brief` (deep‑linkable from emails/LI).
* **No‑JS Fallback:** `<noscript>` renders a static link to `/briefing`.

**Briefing Page Content (single, scannable page)**

* **Top Bar:** Name, role, location, contact buttons (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Download PDF, vCard).
* **Hero Summary:** 2–3 sentence mission‑style pitch + key metrics (e.g., team scaled, systems shipped, IL‑5/6 alignment).
* **Experience Cards:** Picogrid, HubSpot, etc. Each card shows: role, dates, 3–4 achievement bullets, tech/copmliance tags. `View full dossier` link returns to immersive view.
* **Skills Grid:** Core stacks (Go/TS/K8s/Postgres/NATS/Mapbox), domains (C2, edge, IL‑5/6, FedRAMP, RMF).
* **Selected Projects:** 3 high‑impact projects with outcomes and links.
* **Hobbies Strip:** Gaming • K9 • Hiking/MTB • Electronics • Aliens — brief one‑liners, optional links to side missions.
* **Contact CTA:** "TRANSMIT MESSAGE" (same encrypted form).

**Downloadables**

* **PDF One‑Pager** (print‑friendly CSS or server‑rendered): `/briefing.pdf`.
* **JSON Résumé** (for recruiters/tools): `/resume.json` (JSON‑Resume compatible).
* **vCard:** `/mark-tripoli.vcf`.

**Telemetry Events**

* `briefing_opened`, `briefing_download_pdf`, `briefing_contact_clicked`.

**Technical Implementation**

* **Route:** `app/briefing/page.tsx` (Server Component) pulling from the same `/data/sites/*.json` + `/data/profile.json`.
* **Layout:** Tailwind responsive grid, print styles (`@media print`) to format PDF.
* **PDF:** Use a headless print route (Chromium/Playwright at build) *or* client print to PDF with dedicated print CSS.
* **Hotkeys:** Lightweight listener (e.g., `useHotkeys` hook) registered at `App` root (respect focused inputs).
* **A11y:** Skip link before main content, ARIA landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`), semantic headings.
* **SEO:** Add JSON‑LD Person schema on `/briefing` with `sameAs` links; OpenGraph preview.
* **Performance:** Static route with ISR; prefetch `/briefing` on hover of header CTA; under 50KB additional JS.

**Design Notes**

* Visual style matches terminal/map theme but simplified (higher contrast, less motion).
* Maintain brand colors (black/white/neon green) and monospace accent headings.

---

## 25) Engagement Mode (Unique Interaction)

**Concept:** Transform dossier access into a simulated weapons engagement sequence. Instead of passive clicks, visitors actively "engage targets" (job sites, hobbies) using a C2‑style command and visual sequence.

**Modes of Engagement**

* **Lock + Engage:** Clicking a site or typing `engage <target>` locks onto its map coordinates, shows a radar sweep, then plays a missile/drone/laser animation. The "impact" unlocks and decrypts the dossier rather than destroying it.
* **Deploy UAS:** Terminal command `deploy uas <target>` animates a drone icon flying to the HQ, circling, then dropping a glowing intel pod. The pod opens to reveal the dossier.
* **Exfiltrate:** Command `exfil <target>` animates a beam uplink effect, pulling data back into the HUD, then rendering the dossier.
* **AI Copilot:** Copilot text prompts appear: `[COPILOT]: Target locked. Awaiting command. [SCAN] [ENGAGE] [EXFIL]`. User choice triggers corresponding animation.

**Gamification / Easter Eggs**

* Hidden command `fire missile aliens` launches a missile; impact causes UFO sprite to appear, which reveals secret alien dossier.
* "Engage All Targets" button after exploring 3+ dossiers triggers a full‑screen mission completion sequence, ending with the contact form prompt: `MISSION COMPLETE. TRANSMIT MESSAGE TO COMMAND?`

**Technical Implementation**

* **Animations:** Mapbox layers (arcs/lines) + Framer Motion SVG overlays for missile/drone paths; timed text logs in telemetry ticker.
* **Commands:** Add parser in Terminal component for `engage`, `deploy uas`, `exfil`, `fire missile`.
* **Sound:** Optional launch/impact SFX (toggleable in HUD).
* **Fallback:** On mobile/low perf, skip animation and show quick dossier unlock with text log: `[SYSTEM]: Target engaged. Dossier unlocked.`

---

## 26) Job-Specific Engagement Sequences

**Concept:** Each job site has a unique simulated engagement mechanic that reflects the nature of the work. This adds personalization, variety, and narrative depth beyond generic dossier unlocks.

**Picogrid — C2 + Data Integration Layer**

* Command: `deploy integration matrix`
* Map: disconnected blips light up and link to HQ hub.
* Terminal Logs:

  ```
  [SYSTEM]: Disconnected assets detected: Radar / Drone / Camera
  [SYSTEM]: Initiating integration layer...
  [SYSTEM]: Cross-domain links established. Mission vision shaped.
  ```
* Outcome: Unified systems, vision shaping highlighted.

**HubSpot — Developer Platform / Build & Deploy**

* Command: `build pipeline --deploy`
* Terminal: CI/CD‑style logs with progress bar.
* Map: integration pods animate around HQ.
* Outcome: Highlights developer platform, integration frameworks.

**Comcast — Data Center Inventory Management**

* Command: `scan datacenter assets`
* Map: radar sweep reveals nodes.
* Terminal: asset IDs and statuses stream.
* Outcome: Reflects auditing, inventory management tools.

**Amtrak (Engineer Role — Dispatching System)**

* Command: `dispatch train NEC-187`
* Map: glowing rail line along Northeast Corridor; train icon travels.
* Terminal Logs:

  ```
  [DISPATCH]: Train NEC-187 dispatched from Boston
  [TRACKING]: Passing Providence → New Haven → New York
  [SYSTEM]: Arrival confirmed. Corridor operations successful.
  ```
* Outcome: Showcases train dispatching system.

**Amtrak (Operator Role — Dispatcher)**

* Command: `assume dispatcher role`
* HUD: simplified real‑time track allocation schematic.
* Terminal: random movement requests, resolved automatically.
* Outcome: Immerses user in live dispatcher duties.

**Marine Corps — CBRN Defense Specialist**

* Command: `initiate CBRN protocol`
* Map/HUD: biohazard overlay, siren effect.
* Terminal Logs:

  ```
  [CHECKLIST]: Mask on
  [CHECKLIST]: Detection gear active
  [CHECKLIST]: Area secured
  [SYSTEM]: Threat neutralized
  ```
* Animation: hazmat silhouette, chemical plume neutralized.
* Outcome: Cinematic representation of defense role.

---

## 27) Open Questions

* Which unique sequence should have full animation vs. simplified logs for mobile?
* Should engagements be replayable or one‑time unlocks?
* How to handle order of multiple Amtrak roles (merge vs. separate sites)?
